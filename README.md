## Project structure
This repository is organized as follows:

* :open_file_folder: **assets**: images and figures of the project.
* :open_file_folder: **seis2rock**: python library containing routines for seis2rock.
* :open_file_folder: **data**: folder containing data (and instructions on how to retrieve the data).
* :open_file_folder: **notebooks**: set of jupyter notebooks reproducing the experiments in the paper (see below for more details).


## Notebooks for Volve dataset
The following notebooks are provided:

- :orange_book: ``01_Regularization_Comparison_Well_NO_15_9_19_BT2_stacking_wells.ipynb``: Regularization comparison for fence along well NO_15_9_19_BT2.
- :orange_book: ``02_Regularization_Comparison_Well_NO_15_9_19_A_stacking_wells.ipynb``: Regularization comparison for fence along well NO_15_9_19_A. 


## Getting started :space_invader: :robot:
To ensure reproducibility of the results, we suggest using the `environment.yml` file when creating an environment.

Simply run:
```
./install_env_gpu.sh
```
It will take some time, if at the end you see the word `Done!` on your terminal you are ready to go. Î‘ctivate the environment by typing:
```
conda activate rseis2rock_gpu
```

After that you can simply install your package: (double check your new environment is active to proceed as follows)
```
pip install .
```
or in developer mode:
```
pip install -e .
```
